Vertex

0 = vec4 positions
1 = vec4 colour | vec2 texcoord | model positions
2 = instance positions

Vertex Out's
0 vstexcoord/vs_color
1 modelpos
2 instance/image index
3 alpha correction

Textures

1 = Texture Object

Uniform/Storage blocks - global across all shaders
0 = MatrixCalc - see the MatrixCalcUniformBlock.cs

Uniforms - these are per shader, so this is a guide.

21 = transform to look at eye position
22 = object transform position/rotation
23 = common transform - rotation
24 = vec2 texture co-ord offset to apply.
25 = vec4 uniform colour for fragment shader
26 = phase
30 = blend
